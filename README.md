# Apollo GraphQL Basic Project

A basic project built using Apollo Server for GraphQL and using the GitHub API. The frontend uses the ```useQuery``` hook from Apollo Client and calls the backend which then calls the GitHub API and send the response over to display GitHub users with their profile links.
